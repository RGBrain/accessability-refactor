# Accessibility Refactor

Refactoring of a marketing company's webpage to improve SEO and accessibility.  


## Description 

The company in question, Horiseon, provides SEO services, so it was crucial that the site was well-optimised in that regard.  To that end, the code has been improved in a number of ways, including:

HTML
* Added title
* Added semantic HTML
* Added alt image descriptions

CSS
* Refactored
* Added comments

Here is the completed site: https://rgbrain.github.io/accessibility-refactor/
